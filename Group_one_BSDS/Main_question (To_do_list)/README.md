This is a commandline To-Do-List app. It's features include being able to:
Add tasks, and add subtasks under the added task if the user wishes to.Multiple tasks at atime without having to rerun the programme. These tasks can be added to one of four categories (school, personal, Home and ambiguous). These tasks are entered with a time and date of completion.
A user can view an indexed list of the tasks added and their status, whether accomplished or not. The tasks are viewed in different colors including RED for not yet done, GREEN for accomplished and Magenta for a task that has been successfully added. 
A task can be ticked off as accoplished which changes its status color to green from Red. We used the "colorama" module.
The added tasks are added as a JSON file which means they remain or persist.
