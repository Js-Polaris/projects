This is a commandline application that takes currency as input from a user and converts it into the equivalent amount in USD. It uses a realtime exchange ratefrom the ExchangeRate-API.
It then converts any amount from the base currency to the target currency which in this case is from UGX to USD but can be changed to any currency.
Handles errors and network issues and displays them in case any occurs for easy logging.
It also automatically updates every 30s from the ExchangeRate-Api site which works as our server.
